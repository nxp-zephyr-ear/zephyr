NXP RW61X Zephyr Early Access Release Notes

How to get the code
===================

Use the getting Zephyr started guide to setup your development environment. However,
the west init command is as follows:

 $ west init -m git@github.com:nxp-ea-7/zephyr.git -â€“mr rw61x_ear

Then, run:
 $ west update
 
If you previously setup your environment please run the following command to update to a subsequent release:

 $ cd /to/your/zephyr/clone
 $ git fetch 
 $ git checkout -b rw61x_ear origin/rw61x_ear
 $ west update


The Zephyr getting started guide can be found at: https://docs.zephyrproject.org/latest/develop/getting_started/index.html

Release: EAR3.0

BLE support
============

- Increased maximal connections for bt_tester application to 16
- Enabled self low power control for the BLE controller.
- Support of BLE bonding. NVS back-end storage can be
  used to store settings.

BLE applications supported in this release are:
	- peripheral_ht   (samples/bluetooth/peripheral_ht)
	- central_ht      (samples/bluetooth/central_ht)
	- peripheral_ots  (samples/bluetooth/peripheral_ots)
	- peripheral_dis  (samples/bluetooth/peripheral_dis)
	- bt_tester       (tests/bluetooth/tester)
	- shell           (tests/bluetooth/shell)
	- peripheral      (samples/bluetooth/peripheral)

`peripheral` application can be used to experiment the bonding process.

Limitations:
	- Hardware accelerators for security cryptography are not supported yet.
	- Some shell BLE commands may be unsupported for now.
	- Low power with BLE is still undergoing trials. Therefore it's not enabled by default
	  for BLE applications. Please add this Kconfig `CONFIG_PM` to your application
	  to enable low power capabilities.
	  Low power was only tested on peripheral_ht and central_ht.
	- Enforcement of ATT flow control (BT_ATT_ENFORCE_FLOW) is disabled
	  for all BLE applications.

Note:
	- To recover a board running some code causing issues with the debugger, follow those steps :
	  1) Change the boot configuration (CON[3:0]), 2) Reset the board, 3) flash the new application,
	  4) Put back the default boot configuration (QSPI Flash), 5) Reset the board again.
	  This maybe the case when having an application using low power running on the board.

Base Enablement
===============

- Support for the display module has the following improvements from EAR2.0:
	- Rendering performance has been improved with double bufferring
	- Support for touchscreen IC FT7401 has been enabled
