config BOARD_INIT_PRIORITY
	int "Board initialization priority"
	default 45
	help
	  Board initialization priority.

config USE_ELS_PKC_HUK
	bool "For TF-M, use a die internal HUK"
	depends on BUILD_WITH_TFM && MCUX_PSA_CRYPTO_DRIVER_ELS_PKC
	default y
	help
	  For TF-M, use a HUK that is derived from the die internal master key of the ELS.

config USE_ELS_PKC_IAK
	bool "For TF-M, use ELS-backed key for initial attestation"
	depends on BUILD_WITH_TFM && MCUX_PSA_CRYPTO_DRIVER_ELS_PKC
	default y
	help
	  For TF-M, use a IAK that is an ELS internal key derived from the NXP root of trust.

config USE_HARDENED_PLATFORM_INIT
	bool "For TF-M, use hardened platform initialization code"
	depends on BUILD_WITH_TFM
	default y
	help
	  For TF-M, use platform initialization code that is hardened against fault injections.
	  For critical registers, the written value is read back and compared against the wanted
	  value to ensure correctness.

config TFM_PARTITION_LOADER_SERVICE
	bool "Loader service Partition"
	depends on BUILD_WITH_TFM && MCUX_PSA_CRYPTO_DRIVER_ELS_PKC && NXP_FW_LOADER
	default y
	help
	  Setting this option will cause '-DTFM_PARTITION_LOADER_SERVICE'
	  to be passed to the TF-M build system. Look at 'config_default.cmake'
	  in the trusted-firmware-m repository for details regarding this
	  parameter. Any dependencies between the various TFM_PARTITION_*
	  options are handled by the build system in the trusted-firmware-m
	  repository.
